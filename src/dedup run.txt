How To Run Project: 

Install Vmware, Virtual Box (ONLY IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS PROJECT ON SINGLE MACHINE!; otherwise there is no need)
this whole project was deployed on Ubuntu linux OS (virtual machine)

software needs to install on virtual machine(ubuntu)
Mysql (any version)(please refer sql.py for database structure)
gcc

python libs on virtual machine(ubuntu):
hashlib // to calculate sha256 of block
ctypes  // to communicate with C library RAM.so (see NEW_RAM_WHOLE_IP.c)
MySQLdb

How to compile NEW_RAM_WHOLE_IP.c to RAM.so : (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14884126/build-so-file-from-c-file-using-gcc-command-line)
gcc -c -fPIC NEW_RAM_WHOLE_IP.c -o RAM.o
gcc RAM.o -shared -o RAM.so //insert this file on virtual machine(ubuntu)( or on Main Server )

this project runs on multiple servers...
subservers can by anyone..
How to run on Single PC:
	in this project we have 5 sub servers..plus 1 client(means 6 MORE ip addresses)
	we can deploy this project on single pc
	but need more 6 interfaces like "wlan0"
	Therefore we installed ubuntu as virtual machine..
	after installation we added new 6 new interfaces into that OS
	(right click on virtual machine -> see properties of virtual machine)
	
	after having 6 interfaces 
	change ip addresses into all servers code
	
	Now change ip addresses into all servers code
	Now we can execute this project with using "launch.sh"
	
	Result : 
	Here 5 ipaddresses,interfaces will act like subservers..
	1 ip address,interface will act as client (or can be anyone but must be present on Network!)
	default ipaddresses,interface can be main server!
	
How to run on multiple PC's:
	just copy sub server dir to corresponding sub server machine
	here you need to run subserver.py code manually

Now change ip addresses into all servers code

there is no need to install softwares on sub servers
SubServer does not depend on mysql

cilent can be anyone, android, linux pc, windows pc
just install python on client and run Client.py


Code Run Steps:
1. Main Server Execution
2. SubServers Execution(no sequence in execution)
3. Client1 Execution,Client2 Execution,Client3 Execution,Client4 Execution, ..Clientn Execution (exec anyone, anytime!)
