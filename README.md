# Project Deduplication

Data deduplication refers to a technique for eliminating
redundant data in a data set. In the process of deduplication,
extra copies of the same data are deleted, leaving only one copy
to be stored.

Data is analysed to identify duplicate byte patterns to ensure the
single instance of the duplicate part is considered and stored in
the server
