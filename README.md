# Project Deduplication

Suppose two users uploads a same file on server,
files are same therefore to save two copies of same file 
is not a good idea,
on social sites also thousands of users uploads a same image,
video, mp3 files, on cloud.
and hence to use storage in more efficient way we have developed
"Reliability Aware Project Deduplication"

Data deduplication refers to a technique for eliminating
redundant data in a data set. In the process of deduplication,
extra copies of the same data are deleted, leaving only one copy
to be stored.

Data is analysed to identify duplicate byte patterns to ensure the
single instance of the duplicate part is considered and stored in
the server
